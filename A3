6. Write a Java program to handle NumberFormatException.
7. Create a method that takes a string input and converts it to an integer. Handle 
NumberFormatException using try-catch block and prompt the user to enter a valid 
number upon exception.
8. Write a Java program to find the quare root of integer numbers. Demonstrate the use of 
try-catch block to handle ArithmeticException.
9. Create a program that divides two numbers input by the user. Handle the possibility of 
division by zero using try-catch block to catch ArithmeticException.
10. Implement a Java program that calculates the value of the expression (sin(x) + cos(x)) 
/ tan(x) for a given value of x. Handle scenarios where x is close to multiples of Ï€/2 to 
avoid division by zero errors.
11. Write a Java program that computes the value of the function log(sin(x) + cos(x)) / 
(tan(x) - cot(x)) for a given value of x. Ensure proper handling of exceptions that may 
occur due to invalid mathematical operations.
12. Create a Java application that calculates the value of the expression sqrt(abs(sin(x) * 
cos(x))) / (tan(x) + 1) for a given value of x. Handle cases where x leads to division 
by zero or negative values inside the square root function.

13. Design a Java program that evaluates the value of the function (sin(x) * cos(x)) / (sin(x) 
+ cos(x)) for a given value of x. Handle potential arithmetic exceptions that may arise 
due to invalid mathematical operations.
14. Implement a Java application that computes the value of the expression log(abs(sin(x) 
+ cos(x))) / (tan(x) - cot(x)) for a given value of x. Ensure proper error handling for 
potential arithmetic exceptions and negative values inside the logarithmic function.
15. Demonstration of use nested try-catch block. Write a Java program to handle 
NumberFormatException in outer try-catch block and ArithmeticException inside 
the inner try-catch block.
16. Create a Java program to handle ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
17. Implement a Java program that involves dynamic data structures such as linked lists or 
trees, where elements are stored in arrays. Introduce scenarios, where accessing 
elements beyond the bounds of the array backing the data structure results in 
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. Your task is to implement bounds checking and 
handle these exceptions effectively while maintaining the integrity of the data structure.
18. Develop a recursive algorithm implemented in Java that traverses or manipulates 
arrays. Introduce scenarios where the recursion reaches beyond the bounds of the array, 
resulting in ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. Your task is to handle these 
exceptions within the recursive algorithm and ensure proper termination of recursion.
19. Implement a Java program that performs complex manipulations on an array of 
integers. The program should involve operations such as sorting, searching, and 
accessing elements at various indices. Introduce scenarios, where accessing elements 
beyond the bounds of the array leads to ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. Your 
task is to handle these exceptions gracefully and ensure the program continues 
execution without crashing.
20. Develop a recursive algorithm implemented in Java that traverses or manipulates 
arrays. Introduce scenarios where the recursion reaches beyond the bounds of the array, 
resulting in ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. Your task is to handle these 
exceptions within the recursive algorithm and ensure proper termination of recursion.
21. Design a Java program that performs matrix operations such as addition, multiplication, 
and transpose. Introduce scenarios, where accessing elements beyond the bounds of the 
matrix results in ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. Your task is to handle these 
exceptions effectively and provide meaningful error messages indicating the nature of 
the exception.
22. Create a custom checked exception class named CustomCheckedException. Use this 
exception in your program to handle a specific error condition and demonstrate its usage 
using try-catch block.
23. Write a program that reads data from a file and performs some processing. Handle 
checked IOException by using try-catch block to catch and handle the exception.
24. Write a Java program to demonstrate a checked exception (e.g.,
FileNotFoundException) being thrown and caught using try-catch block.
25. Implement a method that reads an integer from the user but handles
InputMismatchException using try-catch block.
26. Implement try-catch-finally blocks to handle ClassNotFoundException and
MethodNotFoundException.
27. Write a program to handle ClassCastException.
